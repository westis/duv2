## Technical Considerations & Challenges

### Technical Challenges

#### 1. Data Volume and Performance
- **Challenge:** Managing large datasets while maintaining performance
- **Approach:** 
  - Efficient pagination and lazy loading
  - Optimized API queries with parameter tuning
  - Strategic caching based on data update frequency
  - Server-side rendering for data-heavy pages

#### 2. Complex Filtering and Search
- **Challenge:** Implementing a comprehensive yet intuitive filtering system
- **Approach:**
  - Progressive disclosure of complex filters
  - URL parameter synchronization
  - Client-side filtering for immediate feedback
  - Strategic server-side filtering for complex queries

#### 3. Responsive Data Presentation
- **Challenge:** Displaying complex tabular data across devices
- **Approach:**
  - Priority-based column display
  - Expandable row details
  - Horizontal scrolling for essential data
  - Alternative views for mobile devices

#### 4. Authentication and Privacy
- **Challenge:** Implementing tiered access while respecting privacy settings
- **Approach:**
  - Clear permission model mapping API tiers
  - User interface adaptation based on permissions
  - Privacy-aware component design
  - Secure authentication implementation

#### 5. API Availability Risk
- **Challenge:** Frontend functionality depends on API availability and performance
- **Approach:**
  - Implement graceful degradation for API failures
  - Create fallback UI states for all API-dependent components
  - Utilize stale-while-revalidate caching to handle intermittent API issues
  - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - Maintain static fallback data for critical sections

#### 5. Internationalization Complexity
- **Challenge:** Supporting multiple languages with specialized terminology
- **Approach:**
  - Context-aware translation keys
  - Specialized sports terminology handling
  - Consistent translation workflow
  - Right-to-left layout support foundation

### Technical Debt Considerations

#### 1. API Versioning
- Plan for API versioning changes
- Abstraction layer for API client
- Backward compatibility handling

#### 2. State Management Scaling
- Initial simple state management may need enhancement
- Plan for potential migration to more robust solutions
- Clear state boundaries and access patterns

#### 3. Component Library Evolution
- shadcn/ui may evolve or change
- Component abstraction for easier updates
- Style system that can adapt to component changes

#### 4. Next.js Version Updates
- Plan for regular framework updates
- Feature usage that minimizes breaking change risk
- Testing strategy for framework updates

### Performance Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Code Optimization
- Tree shaking and dead code elimination
- Component code splitting
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Bundle size monitoring

#### 2. Network Optimization
- API request batching and deduplication
- Strategic data prefetching
- Response compression
- Cache-Control header optimization

#### 3. Rendering Optimization
- Appropriate rendering strategy selection based on content type
- Static generation for stable content
- Incremental static regeneration for semi-dynamic content
- Client-side rendering only when necessary

#### 4. Resource Optimization
- Image optimization and next/image usage
- Font loading optimization
- Third-party script management
- Asset caching strategies

## Risks and Dependencies

### Key Dependencies

#### 1. API Readiness and Stability
- The frontend relies heavily on the DUV Ultramarathon Statistics API
- Any changes to API structure or endpoints may require frontend adjustments
- **Mitigation:** Clear API versioning and abstraction layer in frontend code

#### 2. Data Quality and Consistency
- Frontend experience depends on consistent, well-structured data
- Inconsistencies in historical data may require special handling
- **Mitigation:** Robust data normalization and error handling

#### 3. Third-Party Libraries
- Reliance on Next.js, shadcn/ui, and other libraries
- Future updates may introduce breaking changes
- **Mitigation:** Clear update strategy and component abstraction

### Risk Assessment

#### 1. Performance Risks
