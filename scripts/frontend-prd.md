# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Frontend for DUV Ultramarathon Statistics

**Version:** 1.0 â”‚ **Date:** May 21, 2025

---

## 1. Overview

This PRD outlines the development of a modern frontend for the DUV Ultramarathon Statistics website using Next.js 15. The frontend will:

- Consume the new `/api/v1/` endpoints
- Implement responsive, accessible UI components
- Focus initially on the "4 Rs": Races, Results, Runners, and Records
- Eventually replace the current PHP-based site at [statistik.d-u-v.org](https://statistik.d-u-v.org/)
- Support multilingual content (initially English and German)
- Implement a phased approach, delivering core functionality first

---

## 2. Background & Rationale

The existing DUV statistics website exhibits:

- **Dated user interface**: limited responsiveness on mobile devices
- **Separate page loads**: causing slow navigation between related data
- **Limited data visualization**: minimal graphing and visualization features
- **Rigid filtering**: difficult to combine multiple search criteria
- **PHP-based architecture**: makes frontend improvements challenging

Moving to a modern Next.js based frontend ensures:

- **Modern UI**: responsive design with intuitive navigation
- **Client-side routing**: seamless transitions between data views
- **Enhanced data visualization**: charts, graphs, and interactive elements
- **Improved performance**: server-side rendering and static generation
- **International accessibility**: proper multilingual support
- **Future extensibility**: component-based architecture for easier feature additions

---

## 3. Goals

1. **User Experience:** Create an intuitive, responsive interface optimized for all devices
2. **Performance:** Ensure fast page loads and smooth transitions between views
3. **Discoverability:** Make data easy to find through effective search and filters
4. **Visualization:** Enhance data presentation with charts and interactive elements
5. **Accessibility:** Support users with disabilities through WCAG compliance
6. **Internationalization:** Support multiple languages starting with English and German
