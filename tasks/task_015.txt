# Task ID: 15
# Title: Test and Verify Complete Migration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of all API endpoints and frontend integration to ensure a successful migration.
# Details:
1. Create a test plan covering all API endpoints and frontend pages
2. Test each API endpoint individually:
   - Test with valid and invalid parameters
   - Test with and without API keys
   - Verify response format matches OpenAPI specification
   - Verify error handling for various scenarios
3. Test frontend integration:
   - Verify all pages load correctly with the new API
   - Test user interactions that trigger API calls
   - Verify data is displayed correctly with the new field names
4. Performance testing:
   - Compare response times between old and new endpoints
   - Identify and address any performance issues
5. Security testing:
   - Verify API key validation works correctly
   - Test for common security vulnerabilities
6. Documentation verification:
   - Ensure Swagger UI correctly documents all endpoints
   - Verify examples in documentation work as expected
7. Create a migration report documenting:
   - Successful tests
   - Any issues encountered and their resolutions
   - Performance comparisons
   - Recommendations for future improvements

# Test Strategy:
Use a combination of manual testing and automated test scripts. Create a test matrix covering all endpoints with various parameter combinations. Document all test results and any issues encountered. Verify all success criteria from the PRD are met.
