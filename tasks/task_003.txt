# Task ID: 3
# Title: Refine OpenAPI Specification
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Refine the generated OpenAPI specification to create duv-api-public.yaml by removing private tables/fields and standardizing field names.
# Details:
1. Create a copy of duv-openapi.yaml named duv-api-public.yaml
2. Remove all private tables and sensitive fields
3. Rename columns to follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., Startdate â†’ date)
4. Set appropriate JSON types and formats for each field
5. Add descriptions for each endpoint and parameter
6. Ensure all four core endpoints are properly defined:
   - /api/v1/events.php
   - /api/v1/eventdetail.php
   - /api/v1/performances.php
   - /api/v1/runners.php

# Test Strategy:
Validate the refined YAML against OpenAPI 3.0 specification. Review manually to ensure all private data has been removed and naming conventions are consistent.
