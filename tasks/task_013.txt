Subject: "DUV API v1 Migration Proposal"

Body:
```
Hi Jürgen,

I've completed the initial work on the DUV API v1 migration as we discussed. This new API will provide standardized JSON responses, interactive documentation, and improved security through API keys.

Key benefits:
- Consistent field names and data formats across all endpoints
- Self-documenting API with interactive Swagger UI
- API key authentication for protected data
- Gradual migration path that won't disrupt the current site

You can view the API documentation here: [GitHub Pages URL]

I've attached the OpenAPI specification file (duv-api-public.yaml) which defines all endpoints and data structures.

Next steps for implementation:
1. Create the api_keys table in the database (SQL script attached)
2. Implement the API helper functions and endpoints as outlined in the PRD
3. Create the admin UI for managing API keys
4. Update frontend code to use the new endpoints

Let me know if you have any questions or need any clarification on the implementation details.

Best regards,
Daniel

1. duv-api-public.yaml
