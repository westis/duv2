# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement events.php Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the /api/v1/events.php endpoint to provide a list of events with standardized field names.
# Details:
Create a file named 'events.php' in the /api/v1/ directory with the following content:
```php
<?php
require 'helpers.php';
$db = connectToDatabase();
validateApiKey($db, false); // public access

// Optional: read filter params
$year = $_GET['year'] ?? date('Y');

$query = "SELECT
  ID AS id,
  EventName AS name,
  CountryCode AS country,
  DATE_FORMAT(Startdate,'%Y-%m-%d') AS date,
  Distance AS distance_km
FROM tevent
WHERE YEAR(Startdate)=?";
$stmt = $db->prepare($query);
$stmt->bind_param('i', $year);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();

$events = [];
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
  $events[] = $row;
}

outputJson($events);
```
Ensure field names match those defined in the OpenAPI specification.

# Test Strategy:
Test the endpoint with various query parameters. Verify the response format matches the OpenAPI specification. Test with and without API keys to ensure public access works correctly.
